## Overview
This setup enables content management for the careers page through Netlify CMS, allowing non-technical team members to easily update job postings and career page content.

## Setup Instructions

## Important
This repository currently builds with the Vercel adapter in [astro.config.mjs](/run/media/rahul/New Volume/atek-it-landing-master/astro.config.mjs#L1), while the CMS config in [public/admin/config.yml](/run/media/rahul/New Volume/atek-it-landing-master/public/admin/config.yml#L1) uses Netlify `git-gateway`.

That combination is incompatible on the same deployed domain. If `/admin` is served by Vercel, Netlify CMS will fail with "Unable to access identity settings."

Use one of these supported options:
1. Deploy the site or the admin route on Netlify and keep `git-gateway`.
2. Keep Vercel hosting and switch the CMS backend to a non-Netlify option such as GitHub OAuth.

### 1. Deploy to Netlify
1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Deploy the site with build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory to: `dist`

### 2. Enable Netlify Identity
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to **Identity** tab
3. Click **Enable Identity**
4. Under **Registration preferences**, select "Invite only" or "Open" based on your needs
5. Under **External providers**, you can enable GitHub, Google, etc. (optional)

### 3. Enable Git Gateway
1. In the Identity tab, scroll down to **Services**
2. Click **Enable Git Gateway**
3. This allows Netlify CMS to commit changes back to your repository

### 4. Access the CMS
1. Visit `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/admin/`
2. You'll be prompted to sign up/log in
3. Once authenticated, you can manage career content

## Development Notes

### Adding New Fields
To add new fields to job postings:
1. Update `public/admin/config.yml`
2. Update the `CareerJob` interface in `src/utils/careers.ts`
3. Update the careers component to display new fields

### Customizing the CMS
- Edit `public/admin/config.yml` to modify field types, validation, etc.
- Refer to [Netlify CMS documentation](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/) for advanced configuration

## Security
- The CMS is protected by Netlify Identity
- Only authenticated users can access `/admin/`
- All changes are committed to your Git repository
- Consider using "Invite only" registration for production

## Troubleshooting

### CMS Not Loading
- Ensure Netlify Identity is enabled
- Check that Git Gateway is enabled
- Verify the site is deployed and accessible

### Content Not Updating
- Check that changes are being committed to the repository
- Ensure the build process includes the content files
- Verify file paths in the CMS configuration

### Authentication Issues
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check Netlify Identity settings
- Ensure external providers are configured correctly if using them

### Unable to access identity settings
- This means the current domain is not exposing Netlify Identity endpoints.
- Verify the admin URL is being served by Netlify, not Vercel.
